  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there. Hope your are doing well!</p>

<p>This site was created so people who are intersted in hiring me or just want to get to know me better have all the information they need.
</p>

<p>I started to learn coding around June in 2023 and I imediately fell in love with it. My father is a software developer so I guess it makes sense. I actually should have listened to him
  when he wanted to teach me about coding when I was 17... But hey! Better "late" (I still think 23 is pretty young) than never. 
</p>

<p>But because I don't want to bore you with a long story about my life, I will just give you this screenshot of my CV in which you can find the most important Details about me.
</p>
